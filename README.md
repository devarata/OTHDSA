# OTHDSA

OTHDSA stands for optimised two headed disk scheduling algorithm. 

Disk scheduling is is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

There are many types of single headed disk scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SSTF, SRTF.

This algorithm intends to give faster results compared to single headed disk scheduling alogrithms
